# ok i started this a few days ago and am abandoning it

this is a manual apworld for Mini & Max from the UFO 50 game collection. if anyone wants to pick it back up and finish this AP manual, feel free. i just don't think i would enjoy playing it, so it's pointless for me to develop it.

## ability save file values

For reference, if you receive an ability, set these values to 1.0, or, if you have two of them, set it to 2.0.

Glove = `game41_mmUpgrades_0`
Magic Potion = `game41_mmUpgrades_1`
Special Anklet = `game41_mmUpgrades_2`
Backpack = `game41_mmUpgrades_3`
Protein = `game41_mmUpgrades_4`
Gravity Charm = `game41_mmUpgrades_5`
Boots = `game41_mmUpgrades_6`
Pheromone = `game41_mmUpgrades_7`
Hexan Book = `game41_mmUpgrades_8`
Coffee Ground = `game41_mmUpgrades_9`
Spin Bauble = `game41_mmUpgrades_10`
Chitin Armor = `game41_mmUpgrades_11`
Whistle = `game41_mmUpgrades_12`
Mol Dok Food = `game41_mmUpgrades_13`
Dog Armor = `game41_mmUpgrades_14`
Sacred Wings = `game41_mmUpgrades_15`

Then, there are 8 Energy Egg upgrades, which correspond to `game41_mmThrowPower`
And `game41_mmHPmax` corresponds to your life, which is 3.0 by default. Increase it by 0.5 for every Half Heart upgrade.
Since this randomizer assumes you never actually spend shinies, you can always cheat them in by modifying `game41_mmStars`. Ultimately, what logically matters is the amount of shinies other people have found for you.
